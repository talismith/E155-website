    "text": "Initial Reflections Post\n\n\nI’m very excited to be taking MicroPs this semester! I wanted to take this class because I really enjoyed E85, particularly the portion where we used the FPGA. I found that the labs were much more interesting than the problem sets, so I’m excited to be taking a course with only labs. Some of my goals would be to become more comfortable using FPGAs, and understanding more thoroughly terminology distinctions (such as microprocessors vs microcontrollers), and become super familiar with git.\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 29, 2025\n\n\nTali Smith\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
